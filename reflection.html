            <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
            <p>I’ve had a great experience in Graphic and Web Design Studio this semester – it has been very interesting
                to
                learn about CARP principles as well as the eight typographic systems. I’ve really enjoyed experimenting
                with
                different layouts for the posters and typographic artworks and I feel like I have a much better
                understanding of what makes a good design. I have written more about my design process on the <a
                    class="carp accent" href="carp.html">carp</a> and <a class="typography accent"
                    href="typography.html">typography pages</a>.</p>
            <p>In terms of the web design, as I already had quite a bit of experience in this area, I was very happy to
                have
                my tutors recognise my skills and push me to use more advanced technologies, such as the JavaScript
                animation framework GSAP (GreenSock, 2023) within my work. Further details about my web design process
                can
                be found on the <a class="coding accent" href="coding.html">coding page</a>.</p>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>In this module, we practiced using Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, HTML5 and CSS3. I had an advantage
                in
                that I was already familiar with all four of these, however, this was a great opportunity for me to
                revisit
                and refresh these skills. In particular, I learnt much more about text design options in Illustrator,
                which
                I will absolutely be using in the future.</p>
            <p>Beyond this, my website also utilises JavaScript to create the animations and interactive features such
                as
                the hamburger menu on mobile.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>One of the more challenging aspects of this project has been that, as I’m not working for one specific
                client, I would occasionally find that my tutors had different opinions about what works well,
                particularly
                with regards to the typography artwork. It was actually extremely useful to hear a variety of different
                opinions, however, it made my indecisiveness quite apparent throughout the process. While working on
                this
                project has certainly helped, I hope I can continue to build confidence in my own design choices
                throughout
                my degree and become better at explaining my decisions.</p>
            <p>I also need to make greater use of the content on the reading list. At the start of the semester, I was
                reading very avidly, but, towards the end, I found myself referring to the material less, even when
                struggling to conceptualise designs.</p>
            <p>Finally, with regards to the website, I’m very pleased with my work, and put great thought into the
                design of
                my website through Figma. I should, however, have put more thought into the code design as I found
                myself
                frequently having to refactor elements, which definitely somewhat slowed the coding process. While
                refactoring in production is not unusual, there are certainly aspects of my website where I could have
                saved
                time by further planning my code structure.</p>
            <p>Overall, I think my output has been very successful and I’ve managed to work to the deadline well – there
                was
                never a point where I felt concerned I wouldn’t be able to meet it, which shows effective time
                management
                throughout the semester. I’m also really looking forward to tackling future projects and applying the
                skills
                I’ve learned so far, while learning even more advanced technologies.</p>
